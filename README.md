# Repo for the git-immersion excercise

This is a guided git tutorial composed of various steps. It is based on the gitimmersion excecise by @jimweirich and adopted to the JCE [software engineering course].

You start it by a github classroom invitation from the course materials (and for others by forking to your account).

### General instructions (read this, before you begin): 

1. Red **<font color="red">Note</font>** messages at different steps are emphasising special instructions or trap places.
1. The .rb files in the tutorial are Ruby code files, the exact content and logic is usually not the focus here.
1. Some commands apearing in the tutorial are unix shell commands (rather than git), if you work in a Windows shell you might need to find the equivalent (e.g. steps 11, 21-22). We recommend working with a git aware shell (like the Git Shell installed by GithubDesktop on Windows ot Git Bash install by git for windows).
1. At each stage you can save your work to github by following the last lab step (53): pushing all work to your github account, and then continue elsewhere by cloning or pulling.
1. Finally (step 53) [push][ref-push] all your commits, branches and tags.
1. If you have an improvement suggestion or a bug fix for this tutorial, please open an issue [at the course repo](https://github.com/jce-il/git-immersion/issues), or send a PR with a fix.

### To start follow these steps:
- Install a git client (already exists on our Lab machines)
- Accept the excercise invitation, which will create a private copy of the repository (if you read this you probably did it already :smile:)
- [Clone][cloning] **your** copy of the repository to your machine (e.g., with the green 'clone' button above)
- Follow the online [tutorial](http://jce-il.github.io/git-immersion/index.html) (or the local version included inside this repository, here: ./docs/index.html). Start by clicking the green arrow with "Start Git Immersion".
- Use the left side menu to move beween steps until you complete the tutirial (quite a lot of the 53 steps are actually skipped,  e.g., 46 to 52, see inside).
- Don't forget to push all changes back to github till the deadline including updating your details in this file (above).

Good luck!
