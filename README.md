# Repo for the git-immersion exceceise

Based on the gitimmersion excecise by @jimweirich and adopted to the JCE [software engineering course].

Instructions:

1. Optional: [clone][ref-clone] or download this repository to your local machine.
1. Follow the steps from the included html/index.html file (if you cloned or downloaded it) or just from this [online version](http://jce-il.github.io/git-immersion/html/).
1. Red **<font color="red">Note</font>** messages at different steps are enphasising special instructions or trap places.
1. The .rb files in the tutorials are Ruby code files, the exact content and logic is usually not the focus here.
1. Some commands apearing in the tutorils are unix shell command, if you work in a Windows shell you might need to find the equivalent (e.g. steps 11, 21-22). We recommend working with a git aware shell (like the Git Shell installed by GithubDesktop on Windows).
1. At each state you can save your work to github by following the last step (53) of pushing to github, and continue from another machine by cloning or pulling.
1. Finally (step 53) [push][ref-push] all your commits, branches and tags and submit a link to the commit page of your excercise repo.
1. If you have an improvement or bug fix for this tutorial, please open an [issue](./issues) here or send a PR on a fixing commit.

Good luck!
